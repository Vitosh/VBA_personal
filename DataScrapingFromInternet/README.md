Some time ago I wrote an article for Data scraping from Internet with Excel, which was scraping book information from amazon.com, based on a given word. The code was 25 lines, thus it had some points for improvement. Thus, I have decided to make something bigger out of it with some additional options:

- writing it to Excel, instead of printing to the immediate window
- getting the prices of the books
- scraping multiple titles
- creating some user interface and reporting
- analyzing the data
