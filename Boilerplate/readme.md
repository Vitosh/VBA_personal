# Boilerplate

## The idea 
Boilerplate is an Excel binary file with VBA code in it, which can be used for every new VBA project as a boilerplate.
Building a boilerplate, which is to be used by as a start point for every VBA project was long in my mind. Somewhere in 2016 I have decided to put all the useful VBA code that I am using in a single repository. The repository is  https://github.com/Vitosh/VBA_personal, and up to now it has 30 stars in GitHub and just 1 contributor except for me. The reason for this is that it probably looks a bit unstructured and I am the only one who can somehow find his way among all these files. Anyway, this week I am having some free time, thus I have decided to restart the project again -  create an Excel binary file with VBA code in it, which can be used for every new VBA project as a boilerplate.

## How can I use the boilerplate:
Simply download it and use it!

## What is inside the boilerplate:
Plenty of stuff, which is useful for me. Take a look here for more info:
